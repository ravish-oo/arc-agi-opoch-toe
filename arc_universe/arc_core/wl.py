    1-WL fixed point on disjoint union of presents.

    Per clarifications ยง1 and partition refinement:
    - Seed: hash(RAW[p], CBC3[p])
    - Update: signature-based partition refinement (no hash collisions)
    - BAG = sorted list of colors
    - Stop when stable (guaranteed convergence via monotone refinement)

    Args:
        presents: List of Present structures (train inputs + test input)
        escalate: If True, include E8 (8-connected) neighbors in WL update
        max_iters: Maximum iterations (default 12)

    Returns:
        RoleMap: Dict mapping (grid_id, pixel) -> role_id
        Role IDs are shared across all grids (no test-only roles)

    Acceptance:
        - Deterministic (stable role IDs)
        - E8 only when escalate=True
        - No coords in features (only bag-hashes)
        - Monotone partition refinement (classes only split, never merge)
