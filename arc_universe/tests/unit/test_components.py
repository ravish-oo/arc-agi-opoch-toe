"""
Unit tests for WO-08: arc_core/components.py

Per test plan test_plans/WO-08-plan.md:
- Test component extraction (8-CC, E4 boundary, 4-level sort)
- Test Hungarian matching (lex cost, dummy nodes, Î” computation)
- Test spec scenarios (equal-area, same shapes, multi-match tie)

CRITICAL: All assertions verify EXACT values, not just existence.
Per WO-05/WO-07 lessons: Battle-test the implementation, don't just tick checkboxes.

Goal: FIND BUGS in implementation, not make tests pass.
