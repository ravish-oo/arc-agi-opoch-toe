"""
Unit tests for arc_core/wl.py (WO-03).

Per implementation_plan.md lines 145-155:
- Deterministic role IDs
- Union vs per-grid (must be union)
- E8 escalation behavior
- Stability and convergence

Acceptance criteria:
- Stable IDs (deterministic)
- E8 only when escalate=True
- No coords in features (only bag-hashes)

STRENGTHENED TESTS - Verify implementation against math spec:
- Manual verification of WL iterations
- Union property proven (roles shared across grids)
- E4/E8 neighbor sets verified
- Bag computation verified
- Convergence with intermediate states
