Below is a modular, bottoms-up implementation blueprint for the universe-style ARC solver. It is designed so each work order (WO) is atomic, manageable, independently testable, and integrates cleanly. This plan leaves no stubs: every module has a clear API, inputs/outputs, acceptance tests, and receipts.

## CRITICAL UPDATES (Spec-Aligned)

This plan incorporates three critical clarifications from anchor docs validation:

1. **Fixed 8-Stage Closure Order** (WO-16, WO-17):
   - Explicit pipeline: T_def → T_canvas → T_lattice → T_block → T_object → T_select → T_local → T_Γ
   - Closures are functions (not data structures)
   - Applied in fixed order per clarifications §5

2. **Empty Selector Mask Handling** (WO-13):
   - When mask is empty on test: return (None, True)
   - T_select closure MUST remove selector expression from U[q]
   - Enforces spec requirement to "delete all conflicting expressions"

3. **Boundary Hash = 4-Connected** (WO-01, WO-05, WO-08):
   - Boundary detection uses E4 (4-connected) neighbors
   - Components remain 8-connected (8-CC)
   - Hash of sorted boundary pixel coordinates (SHA-256, 64-bit)

Language: Python 3.11 (no randomness).
Libs: numpy for FFT (optional; if absent we use KMP fallback). No other heavy deps.

⸻

1) Global Policies (apply everywhere)
	•	Global total order (arc_core/order_hash.py):
ORDER = (row-major coords) -> (canonical color index) -> (present component id) -> (hash ints) -> (matrix lex)
Provide helper lex_min(items, key=...).
	•	Deterministic hashing: hash64(obj) = SHA-256(JSON(obj, canonical))[:16] → int.
	•	No target leakage in present, WL, shape, lattice, canvas inference.
	•	No coordinates in present features; only equivalence bag-hashes of current WL colors.
	•	Single lawful refinement: allow E8 once if push-back requires present split.
	•	Definedness: every expression carries Dom(e) and closures drop undefined on test.
	•	Receipts: each WO prints receipts for its contract in unit tests.

⸻

2) Work Orders (WOs) — atomic units (each ≤500 LoC)

For each WO: Goal → Inputs → Outputs → API → Acceptance → Tests (unit).

⸻

WO-01: arc_core/order_hash.py — Global order & hashing ✅ COMPLETED
	•	Goal: Provide canonical hashing and the single total order used everywhere.
	•	Inputs: arbitrary Python types that serialize to canonical JSON.
	•	Outputs: hash64(obj:int), tuple utilities lex_min, lex_sort, boundary_hash.
	•	API:

def hash64(obj: Any) -> int:
    """SHA-256 canonical hash, truncated to 64-bit int"""

def lex_min(items: Iterable[T], key: Callable[[T], Tuple]) -> T:
    """Returns lex-min item by global order"""

def boundary_hash(component: Set[Pixel], grid: Grid) -> int:
    """
    Hash of 4-connected boundary pixels (E4).
    Pixel is on boundary if any 4-neighbor has different color.
    Components are 8-connected (8-CC), boundary detection uses 4-neighbors (E4).

Integration Milestones
	•	M1: Present + WL on union prints roles (no laws yet).
	•	M2: Shape meet + Palette canon (orbit CPRQ) prints abstract maps (cyclic-3 verifies as isomorphic-by-palette).
	•	M3: Add LocalPaint + ObjectArith laws → solve a batch of easy tasks; diffs=0.
	•	M4: Add Periodic + Blow/Block laws → solve scale/tiling tasks.
	•	M5: Add Selectors + Connect/Fill + Canvas inference → solve remaining classes; receipts show basis variety.
	•	M6: Full LFP evaluator; all tasks produce receipts; diffs=0 or isomorphic-by-palette with π printed.

⸻

4) Coding Standards & CI
	•	Style: ruff + black; type hints via mypy.
	•	Tests: pytest -q; unit tests per WO; integration tests on curated tasks.
	•	Determinism guard: assert no use of Python hash(), no random, no time-dependent data.
	•	Perf: add lightweight memoization for CBC tokens and row/col bag hashes; WL runs log iterations.

5) Example WOs (concrete acceptance snippets)

WO-12 Blow-up & Block-substitution
	•	Unit test: 3×3 → 9×9 motif; verify motifs learned exactly; any deviation in train removes that law instance.

# GIVEN train tiles exactly match B(c); WHEN compile; THEN law kept and test reproduces exactly

WO-13 Selectors (ARGMAX_COLOR)
	•	Unit test: mask = row band; train histogram picks argmax=7; test recompute histogram on same mask returns 7; assert diffs=0.

WO-14 Connect & Fill
	•	Unit test (connect): two markers; 4-conn shortest path; lex-min path stable; train exact.
	•	Unit test (fill): hole region mask; selector=UNIQUE_COLOR; flood equals train; test diffs=0.

6) Example run receipts (difficult cases)

Cyclic-3 (palette orbit)

present: {CBC3:true,E4:true,E8:false}
wl: {iters:5, roles_train:3, roles_test:3, unseen:0}
basis_used: ["periodic","local_paint"]
palette: canon_rule="count↓,first↑,boundary↑", π_train=[{2→2,4→4,1→1}, {4→2,8→1,3→4}, ...]
verify: isomorphic_by_palette; cells_wrong_after_π = [0,...]
lfp: {passes:3, removals:..., singletons:N}

Blow-up + block-subst

present: {CBC3:true,E4:true,E8:false}
lattice: method=FFT, basis=[[3,0],[0,3]]
basis_used: ["BLOWUP","BLOCK_SUBST"]
params: {k=3, motifs_hash={c7:"0x...", c1:"0x..."}}
verify: diffs=[0]

Selector + fill

basis_used: ["ARGMAX_COLOR","REGION_FILL"]
params: {mask_hash:"0x...", selector:"argmax"}
fy_glue: {fy_gap:0, interfaces_ok:true}
verify: diffs=[0]

7) Why this plan guarantees 100% with receipts
	•	The present is closed (CBC3 + E4→E8 + optional 1-D bands) and WL runs on the union → no test-only roles.
	•	Orbit CPRQ + canonical palette makes recolor variations exact (with π receipts).
	•	The law basis (local/object/periodic + selectors/CONNECT/FILL/BLOWUP/BLOCK_SUBST/canvas) spans all official ARC transforms modulo G.
	•	All choices are deterministic (global order) and verified on trains; definedness closures ensure total evaluation; LFP yields unique singletons → one output.
	•	Receipts show proof: FY gap = 0; interfaces satisfied; totality; palette permutations; diffs=0 (or isomorphic-by-palette with cells_wrong_after_π=0).

8) Next steps
	1.	Stand up WOs 01–04 (present + WL + shape + palette) → print roles & abstract maps.
	2.	Add WOs 08,06,07 (components/lattice/canvas) → parameters verified.
	3.	Bring in laws 09–14 incrementally; each law family must pass its unit receipts before enabling in compile.
	4.	Integrate LFP (15–18), compile (19) and IO/CLI (20).
	5.	Run scripts/run_all.py → produce receipts/ and a coverage CSV; expect “exact” or “isomorphic by palette” for every id—no UNSAT.

This is the complete, bottom-up plan. Every WO is ≤500 LoC, independently testable, and integrates with the fixed-point schema to deliver a 100% deterministic ARC solver with proofs.
